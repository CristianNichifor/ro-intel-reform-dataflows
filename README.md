# RO Intel Reform · Data Flows Demo

Interactive demo of the **current** and **target-state** information data flows between
Romania's intelligence, oversight, judicial and civilian institutions — the technical companion
to the Romanian Intelligence Reform Policy Blueprint.

> Everything in this repo is a simulation. No real data, no real systems.

[Romanian README](README.ro.md) · [Docs in Romanian](docs/ro/) · The app UI itself is bilingual (EN/RO).

## What's inside

| Tab | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Design principles and how the demo maps to the spec |
| **Current State** | Interactive graph of the pre-reform flows (C1–C10) with clickable nodes/edges |
| **Target State** | Interactive hub-and-spoke architecture (T1–T18 + warrant tokens) |
| **Handshake T3–T6** | Step-through simulation of a legal cross-agency data request |
| **Red Team** | An unauthorized mass query gets blocked twice and logged |
| **Oversight** | Aggregated metrics + hash-chain integrity of the audit ledger |
| **Audit Ledger** | The live append-only ledger (real SHA-256 hash chain, in-browser) |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server
npm run build    # typecheck + production build
npm run lint     # oxlint
```

## How it works

- **Graphs** — [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) rendered from the flow tables in `src/data/`.
- **Warrant tokens** — the SSC mock issues tokens bound to case ID, predicate, subjects, time
  window and receiving agency. Signatures use HMAC-SHA-256 (Web Crypto) as a stand-in for the
  spec's Ed25519.
- **Audit ledger** — every transaction is appended to a real hash-chained ledger
  (`SHA-256` via Web Crypto). Integrity is verifiable on the Oversight tab.
- **Everything is in-browser** — no backend, no persistence.

## Design principles (abridged)

1. **No single mass database** — data stays at source; sharing is event-driven.
2. **Purpose limitation** — every flow is bound to a legal predicate + warrant ID.
3. **Case-by-case handshake** — audited, logged request–approval transactions.
4. **Judicial gate** — content flows only through SSC warrant tokens.
5. **Oversight visibility ≠ operational access** — metadata and audit logs, not raw content.
6. **De-militarized civilian agencies** — flows terminate in civilian authority chains.
